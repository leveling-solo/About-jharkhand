                <p>
                central goverment formed a committee on the jharkhand matter in 1989 . It stressed the need of greater alloacation of the developemnt funds for the area . There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill area of Assam . Other tribal areas wre covered by the fifth schedule of the constituation . Chotanagpur and Santal pargamna development boards were constituted under the chiarmanship of then chief minister of Bihar under the provision of the fifth schedule in 1972 . They failed to achieve the desired result . JMM wanted more represntation and AJSU was against it . Due to the diffenrces these parties broke away form each other . The All jharkhand Students Union introduced elements of violence in the movement and called for a boycott of election while Jharkhand Mukti Morcha Opposed this . The Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council were given repsonisbility for forty areas including agriculture , rural health , public work , public health and minearls. The council has power to recommend for legislation to the Assemnly through the state goverment and to frame bylaws and regulations. 
                <br><br>
                In 1998 , when the separate state mvoement was falling apart , justice Lal pingley Nath Shahdedo was leading the movemnet . In 1998, th Union goverment decided to sent the bill concerning the formation of jharkhand state to Bihar Legislative Assembly to which Lalu prasad Yadav had said that the state would be divided over his dead body . A total 16 poliitcal parties including the Bharatiya jnata Party , Jharkhand Mukti Morcha . All Jharkhand Students Union and congress came in one platfrom the "All party Separate State Formation Committee " . to the start the movement. Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee. The voting on jharkhand Act was to be done on 21 Septemebr   1998 in Bihar Legislation . On that day the committee , under the leadership of Shahdeo called for Jharkand Bandh and organised a protest march . Thousands of Supporters of a separate state took to streets led by Shahdo . he was arrested and detained in a police station for hours along with many supporters. 
                <br><br>
                IN 1999  Bharatiya Jnata party promised to form a separate Vanachal State if they won the state election with a  majority of votes. After the last Assemebly election in the state resulted in  a hung assembly , RJD's dependence on the Congress extended support on the precondition that RJD would not pose a hurdle to the passage of the Bihar reorganisation Bill . Finally , with the support from both RJD and congress , the ruling coalition at the Centre led by the Bharatiya Janta Party which had made statehood its main poll plank in the region in successive polls eariler , cleared the Bihar reorganisation Bill in the monsoon session of the parliament on 2 and 11 August in Loksabha  and Rajyasabha . THis paved the way for the creation of a separate Vanachal state comporising Chota Nagpur Division and Snathal Paragana Division of South Bihar . NDA formed to the Goverment with Babulal marandi as chief Minister Later the name of the state was changed from Vanachal to Jharkhand . Babulal Marandi took the oath of chief minster on 15 November 2000 on the anniversary of the birth of tribal leader Birsa Munda .

            The dynamics of resources and the politics of developement stil influence the socio-economic structures in jharkhand , which was carved out of the relatively underdeveloped sourthern part of Bihar.

        <h1 style="width: 26vw;">Naxal Insurgency </h1>
        <p>
        Jharkhand has been at the center of the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency. Since the uprising of the Naxalites in 1967 ,6,000 people have been killed in fighting between the Naxalites and counter-insurgency operations by the police , and its paramillitary groups such as the salwa judum .

        Despite having a presence in almost 7.80 % of india's geographical area . (home to 5.50% of india's population ), the state of jharkhand is part of the "Red Corridor " comporising 92,000 square kilometers, where the highest concentration of the groups estiamated 20,000 combatants fight. Part of this is due to the fact that the state harbous an abundance of natural resources , while its people live in abject poverty and dstitution . The imporvished state provides ample recruits for communist insurgenst , who argue that they are fighting on behalf of the landless poor and tribals that see few benefits from the resource extractions. As the federal goverment holds a monopoly on sub-surface resources in the state , the tribal popualtion is prevented form staking any claim on the resources extracted from their land . In response , the insurgents have recently begun  a campaign of targeting infrastructure related to the extraction of resources vital for indian energy needs , such as coal .

            On 5 March 2007 , Sunil Mahato , a member of the national parliament , was shot dead by Naxalite rebels near Kishanpur while watching a football match on the Hindu festival of Holi .
